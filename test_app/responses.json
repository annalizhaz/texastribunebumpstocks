And I talked to chairman Grassley of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and I believe that once the investigation is complete and we learn all aspects of what attributed to this event, then we should have a hearing and look into it, and that should include the bump stock, but also any other aspect of this terrible crime that we need to look at from a federal perspective.\""

I have always been a strong supporter of the second amendment, and disarming America, by increasing legislation, will not fix problems like this.\""
